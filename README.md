# Restaurant-Landing-Page

This project features a modern, responsive landing page for a restaurant, designed using HTML and CSS. The page includes the restaurant's name and a navigation menu, a hero section with a high-quality background image and a call-to-action button, and an About section with a brief introduction to the restaurant. The Menu section highlights featured dishes with descriptions and images, while the Contact section includes a contact form and essential contact details. The design focuses on visual appeal, user experience, and responsiveness, ensuring the page looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. It is optimized for fast loading and accessibility to effectively communicate the restaurantâ€™s brand and engage users.
